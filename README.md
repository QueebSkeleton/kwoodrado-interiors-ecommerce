## E-Commerce Parts

The E-Commerce site involves two major parts:

1. **Front Store** - contains the landing page and the main store pages of the site. Typically these are the pages that the customers buy wooden furnitures from.
1. **Administrator Dashboard** - pages that the owner interacts with to monitor everything that happens in the site.

## Technologies Used

This project does not incorporate trending technologies. It only takes advantage of an easy-to-use stack merely for
the sake of a final requirement.

The E-Commerce built is **monolithic** in nature, and is a typical **web-application** that presents dynamically
generated HyperText pages. Some dynamic pages incorporate asynchronous requests to gain the benefits of a Single-Page App,
but the application overall isn't a SPA.

1. **PHP: HyperText Preprocessor** - the main backing language of the application. Used for easily creating web-applications
that can be launched without difficulty.
1. **MariaDB** - an open-source fork of MySQL, this is the main Relational DBMS that the application interacts with to store
data.
3. **000webhost** - free hosting service to be used. Supports PHP and MariaDB.
